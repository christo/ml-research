## The API Line

There's a meme going around to explain who wins and who loses in the AI revolution.

> Above vs below The API Line is the new white collar / blue collar class distinction.

The _API Line_ demarcates two groups of people: those who tell the machines what to do and those who are told what to do by the machines. This seems to voice what many people have been thinking as they reel from the realisation that their position may be downgraded in the near future.

In this conception, the human machine interface is characterised as a single phase transition between "above" (high status) and "below" (low status) that appears to merely version bump the traditional lingo of Marxist class distinction. Are people's identities defined by singular membership in this binary pair? The typical example given is of a delivery driver who responds to directions provided by an app. These people are said to be below the API because they are "told what to do" by the machine whereas someone somewhere else is placing an order and this person is said to be above the API.

While the API Line idea doesn't preclude the possibility that being above or below the API may change over time or across circumstances, the aim of the meme appears to be familiar appeal, reusing traditional class strata and attempting to advise people to position themselves for upward mobility with STEM knowledge and market value for a future where their present knowledge work may be automated away by services too cheap to meter.

Clearly people benefit from an accurate anticipation of their future but I suggest this model carries excess baggage.

A more useful model might be a "horizontal" network of API interfaces that people interact across, exchanging competitive value on a case by case basis. If a person drives a car, it might seem clear they are "above the API" of the car but they may request navigation through an API and the route could be chosen by an opaque algorithm that serves the needs of nearby fast food advertisers, toll road operators or particularly successful neighbourhood lobbyists seeking reduced local traffic. Each person has unique goals and may intrinsically value certain activities - for some it is driving a car. Each person has different needs, resources and different access to and skilled understanding of the APIs. Each has different predictions for the future. Also, each has different awareness of the people and organisations on the other side of the API, imagining them in varying detail and accuracy.

Given all these differences, what's most important for any agent (person, organisation or autonomous system) in this API network is their actual and understood relative negotiating power in the context of viable alternatives. When we "Add to Cart", we do not expect to be able to propose a chaper price, while we might be offered one by a retailer. We may be in a position to read reviews, but are they gamed? Who is calling the shots? These are surely signals of relative power. Consider how likely it is we will be offered a deal when shopping with a retailer operating in a highly competitive market whose customers expectably have dozens of tabs open to evaluate their many alternatives.
