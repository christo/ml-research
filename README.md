# ML Research

My notes and random code for teaching myself basic machine learning (neural networks).

Also some code written to explore these ideas by implementing them from scratch.

[Colour Prototype](color-prototype/README.md)

WIP: write simple neural network from scratch for detecting colour names.
TODO: collect colour data from somewhere
TODO: reimplement colour nn to mit scratch
